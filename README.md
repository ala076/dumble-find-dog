# Dumble

## Description
Built this project to allow humans to pick their favorite dog breeds.
With a random selection of 10 dogs you are a few clicks away from discovering your favorite dog breed.
We learned how to work with third party APIs and to pull in outside data while working in a group, each contributing and pushing code.
We used agile project management style to efficiently create this app including a stand up meeting each scheduled day.

## User Story

As a user, I want to visit a website that can tell me what my favorite dog breed is

Acceptance criteria: it is accepted when I know what my favorite dog breed is

Given a user visits our website, we guide them to know their favorite dog breed
When a user visits out website
Then they are presented with a choice between two dogs
When a user selects a dog
Then that dog is saved in local storage
When a user has gone through all the selections
Then the user will be presented with their favorite breed


## Installation

We wrote the code from scratch and utilized the dog API to fetch data about 10 random dogs and day js to pull in the current date.  Then we used github pages to deploy the application to the web.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    
![screenshot of application](/assets/Screenshot%202023-07-27%20at%206.54.56%20PM.png)


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
